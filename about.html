                    Our goal is to promote an active interest in computer science among all people who might find it interesting. We think that includes just about everyone. By providing materials that are free for people to use, adapt, and teach, more people may find that CS can be an interesting, practical, and worthwhile skill. Learning should be an opportunity that is afforded to anyone, not just those who can pay for it. Free content enables anyone with access to the Internet to learn about computer science in an engaging and open environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having open source content that incorporates changes submitted by educators means that this course is not static. As more people use Bitwisr lessons, the course can grow and develop, adapting to new developments in the world of computer science. User contributed materials also mean that it develops in response to the people who use it most: educators and learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If computer science is to become an integral part of education, it must be introduced in a way that gives meaning and creates passion. Rather than listening to a disembodied voice drone on about what someone is typing in a text editor, we think that time could be better spent getting people excited about a topic and encouraging them to explore it on their own.

                    One of the greatest things about using GitHub to host content is the concept of forking a repository. A fork is a copy of an existing respository that you can use to create something new. If you have an idea about how you want to teach (or learn) from this material, you can fork the Bitwisr repository and add in your own changes! All of the content on GitHub is licensed with a Creatve Commons License, so you don't have to pay any roalties to use the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The other important benefit of using GitHub is its built in Version Control. Because GitHub was designed for programmers, and because programmers need to add features and correct mistakes, there are tools that allow contributors to add these changes in non-destructive ways. The administrators of the respostory can review any suggestions and merge them into the main branch of code. This means that people with ideas to help make this curriculum better can make modifications to the content and submit it for review. If you have forked the repository, made an awesome change or added some useful material, you can submit a pull-request, and we will review your work and add it to the main repository, for the whole world to see!

                <h1 class="c">How can you be sure the content is accurate?</h1>
                <p>
                    Making sure that our lessons are accurate in an open source content model is one of the most important aspects of designing a curriculum that is meant to be useful to educators and learners. There are several measures that we take to make sure that all the material is up-to-code, so to speak.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Admins</strong><br>
                        The core content for Bitwisr is written and produced by people who have demonstrated knowledge in the field: our official admins on GitHub. This means that our lessons are less like a Frankensteine-esque menagerie of anonymously-generated content and more like a collection of articles written by people who know something about things where people can suggest new ideas and new approaches to learning.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Pull <em>Request</em></strong><br>
                        In order for people to change the content on the Bitwisr repository or add new information, they must first submit a pull request indicating what changes have been made. The key word here is request. Changes are not blindly accepted into the official repository without first being review by the official contributors. This allows us to vet any information and decide whether or not it is valid.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Source in Open Source</strong><br>
                        Wherever possible, our content is checked against other sources so that you can verify what we say. This is all referenced by citations at the bottom of each lesson, where are sources are linked so anyone can see where we get our information. There are also links to other resources that explain a particular piece of information in-depth, so that students can learn more about the concepts that are presented in these lessons.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The Issue Tracker</strong><br>
                        Along with the other tools provided for code management, GitHub also has a built in issue tracker. This means that if anyone notices errata in our lessons, they can flag the errors and the contributors can get on top of it!
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Plug and Play</strong><br>
                        All of the example code has an added benefit in terms of ensuring accuracy: programming languages are standardized. This means that we can test any code that is written or submitted by simply running it. In the case of the Introduction to Computer Science, this takes the form of rendering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in various web browsers and running Python scripts on different operating systems to ensure cross-platform compatability. All of these languages are regulated and standardized by organizations (W3C for HTML and CSS, ECMA for JavaScript, and the Python Software Foundation for Python).

                    Each lesson has is designed to cover a specific part of a computer science curriculum, like how to structure an HTML document, or what control structures are. Each lesson <em>also</em> has theme, taken from another area of learning like literature, grammar, or philosophy. The idea is that by combining these two fields, we as educators can make content that is interesting, informative, and inspiring for learners.

                    <strong>For example...</strong> In the lesson on Loops in Python, students are first introduced to the history of the Maya. While this may not seem like the most appropriate subject to discuss when we could be spending valuable time covering the nuances of iterative operators, the parallels that can be drawn are incredibly useful and intriguing.</p><p>One of the most well known, or at least well recognized aspects of Maya culture is their calendar. This remarkably accurate tool of chronological measurement works in the exact same way as nested loops in computer program. By the end of the lesson, students will have learned something about both computer science and history. Their assignment for the class? Design and code their own version of the Maya calendar.
